## Strings Test


**what characters can you wrap strings in?**

Single and double quotes.


**why does this work `alert(5);` but not this `alert(nope sorry doesn’t work);`**

The second one doesn't work because the message isn't in qutations. Numbers can go without quotes but strings can't. 


**how do you put together two strings?**

With a + sign.


**how do you write a javascript variable?**

var = something or var something = something else


**what’s wrong with this: var fullName = firstName + lastName?**

You have to make it equal to the answer of "What is your name?"


**what do javascript lines normally end with?**

A semicolon.
